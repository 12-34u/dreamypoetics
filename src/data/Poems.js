        title: "The Sudden Void", 
        content: `On the cusp where real and myth entwine
I step through cracks to make you mine
you become the streets of your favorite city
and i wander through your shimmering gritty
your words, like winds not bound by sky
your eyes hold silence gods pass by
Maybe the dream’s now over,
love once extreme now slower.
Hands once held are slipping,
awake in a world where love’s hard keeping.
City once shimmering, gritty with fire,
lies now in ashes, a spent, broken choir.
You live in the ember still burning my chest,
yet the ashes cry out for the warmth they’ve possessed.
Not in the stones, not in earth, not in air,
your absence is everywhere, painfully bare.
Even the sky wears a silence estranged,
a world I once knew now forever changed.
This love might unmake me, bone from bone,
turn the maps of my soul into something unknown,
I now don't ask the fire, scared of the flame,
for once it consumes us, there's no one to name,
To lose desire is never to bleed,
yet what it grants and rends plants a cruel seed.
The chapters that follow are shattered, forlorn,
the story unmade, the pages rent and torn.
But here ends the book we were writing,
when at last we have given up fighting.
The walls around us lie shattered, broken,
yet inside myself, I remain unspoken.

        title: "The Sacred Scent", 
        content: `Shall I surrender to divine love, or worship deep and true?
In every path my soul may take, it always leads to You.
Should I fill myself with thought’s deep sound,
Or behead the self, in silence unbound—
In both, I know You dwell in me,
The truth, the breath, eternally.
Perhaps we are worlds apart, yet near in soul,
And time may delay the moments to be whole,
But in your eyes, divine stories unfold—
I see the sacred truths your spirit has told.
I am the word and you by grace make it an art,
I am the language and you are its beating heart,
Each word I shape begins to fade,
As higher hands craft what I’ve made.
To witness a love as deep as ours, the flute waits,
Then plays its song to weave our fates.
Now adorned with your divine scent, I am the breeze,
A mystic aroma that moves with ease.
All are drawn to this spiritual hue,
But only you awaken it, pure and true.
No other perfume shall my spirit claim,
This holy scent alone bears my true name.
You alone are in my heart, my life, my breath,
The divine presence that transcends all death.
Forever in You, my spirit finds its rest,
In Your eternal love, I am truly blessed.
Where You abide, I find my sacred place,
Without Your presence, all is void and space.
You pulse within me, life’s eternal song,
How can You be far, when to You I belong?`

        title: "Paint Me in Divine Red", 
        content: `O my Supreme, come paint me in your divine red,
Don’t tease me from afar—pull closer the thread.
Accompany me in our celestial dance,
You lead with grace; I follow your stance.
Then caress my face with your crimson brush,
As my cheeks bloom pink beneath your blush.
Hold gently this body of fragile glass,
And dress it in love with each soft caress.
Drench me in hues where every color sings of you,
Then let me wander, adorned in your sacred hue.
Let my eyes perceive You in the sacred hues on me,
And let my very being be immersed in Your divinity.
O my Supreme, come paint me in your divine red,
Don’t tease me from afar—pull closer the thread.
O my Divine Feminine, let me paint you in the sacred hue,
Let me hold your hand and walk beside you through the dew.
Then bathe me once more in your sacred hue,
In tranquil blues, pure and true.
Wrap me close in your divine embrace,
That none but You can glimpse my hidden face.
Then touch your body, fragile as glass,
Hide you gently, and take you away from the mass.
And when I color you with crimson red,
I’ll kiss the rosy blush on your face that shyly spreads.
Then hold you close as we sway in our celestial dance,
While the divine flute decides our fate, witnessing our trance.
O Supreme, O Divine, in surrender and love we unite,
Bound by sacred colors in eternal light.`

        title: "Devotee's Ache", 
        content: `O my devotion, behold your devotee,
Words that arise from sacred scrutiny.
Eyes that hold the peace of eternity,
Still long to bask in your serenity.
A love that bloomed through serendipity,
Bathed in the sacred light of your felicity.
Waiting on messages, like letters sent by white birds,
We haven't spoken, yet I've known you through lives and births.
Your feet so pure, I pause to gaze with grace,
To touch, to feel, and cleanse them in Ganges' embrace.
The one whose essence aligns with sacred basil,
A soul untouched by storm or hassle.
Let him now witness, and let our story unfold—
With a flute in his hands, or hands on his hips, bold,
Now don't torment me from staying afar,
For my heart longs, like a wishing star,
To be valued is you being my priority,
Where none of us claim the authority, 
Long for you, though you're in me,
I search with eyes, though you're the vibe around me,
To be liked is but a fleeting reflection,
But to be valued is a divine connection.
Not just a whisper in the winds of time,
But a bond eternal, a love sublime.`

        title: "Abyssal Eyes", 
        content: `O the keeper of abyssal eyes, let me sink into them and never return,
Paint me into your divine hue and never shall my colour turn,
I'd wait until the stars align just right,
Until then i breathe you and you stay in sight,
You teach me your moves and then we dance in rain,
Just hold hands in a way we forget the longing and pain,
Let my reverence hold the stars and skies,
Whilst your reverie trasncends you to places beyond sight,
Eyes as calm and vast as space coloured brown,
Everytime i look into them, i drown,
Now don't tease me being so distant from me, 
I long for you even when you reside in me,
Now let the skies for us decide,
Bodies apart but the souls coincide,
Your name so holy and divine as basil,
Before you bow the hosts and dazzle,
Revered in your name like reverie,
Your presence, my soul's only clemency,
No need for touch to feel you near,
Your breathe is in the air and atmosphere, 
So until you arrive, let me live where you've been,
Inside the essence beneath my skin.`

        title: "Divine Essence", 
        content: `You are in my heart, my every breath,
I sense you close yet out of reach,
In search of you outside but you're within,
Like a sacred flame beneath my skin,
You're the emotion that never binds,
And this feels beyond truth and lies,
Colour me in your sacred hue,
Let all I was dissolve in you.
No self remains, no lines, no name,
Just your reflection in my flame,
Your absence is also your presence,
In my eyes it's pure love's essence,
Your eyes trap me as if the soul wants to speak,
To resume the love that was left before ages,
To resume writing the same old love,
In a new book, on new pages,
Writing books from eternity to eternity,
Where our souls align again in serenity,
Names diminished, identities left behind,
Only essence of love, endless and refined,
You're the pinnacle of my surrender,
My summit of devotion,
In you, resides my highest devotion,
Yet some more time left for you to recognize,
A bit more patience in disguise,
Soon you'll realise the love's presence,
And then nothing halts our divine essence.`
